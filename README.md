 So, here we have made a "Quiz Game" in C++ , as a requirement of our college project for object oriented programming in C++.The program is a console-based quiz game with several features and modes, implemented in C++. It offers a variety of quiz experiences through its structured classes and methods. It offers various Modes to the player which are Standard quiz mode in which Players answer questions in a sequence, earning $1000 for each correct answer until they answer incorrectly or run out of questions, another mode is Multiplayer mode in which Two players take turns answering questions, with scores accumulated for each correct answer and the player with the highest score wins and lastly “Millionare” mode which is A single-player mode with increasing difficulty, prize money and time limits. Players progress through levels, answering questions within specified time limits to win more money. This program is designed to be both educational and entertaining, testing players' knowledge across various questions and providing different ways to play and compete.The overall project covers all the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) , including file handling as well.
